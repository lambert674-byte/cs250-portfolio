## Module Eight Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing on what the user is trying to accomplish and translating that goal into clear requirements and acceptance criteria. User stories help because they keep development centered on user value (“who, what, why”) and make it easier to break work into manageable tasks that can be planned, built, tested, and demonstrated within a sprint.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development by working in small increments and improving through feedback. I want to continue using Agile practices like maintaining a prioritized backlog, sprint planning, daily communication, sprint reviews for feedback, and retrospectives to continuously improve both the product and the team’s process.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates clearly, follows through on commitments, and supports the team’s shared goals. It also means being open to feedback, collaborating to remove blockers, and following shared quality standards such as a Definition of Done so the team consistently delivers working software.
